# C-based Implementation of LogCluster Algorithm

**How to manually compile the source files:**
In terminal, change directory to this folder and execute "gcc -O2 -o logclusterc *.c" command. The executable file named "logclusterc" then will be generated.

LogCluster is a density-based data clustering algorithm for event logs, introduced by Risto Vaarandi and Mauno Pihelgas in 2015.
 
A detialed discussion of the LogCluster algorithm can be found in the paper (http://ristov.github.io/publications/cnsm15-logcluster-web.pdf) published at CNSM 2015.

The C-based implementation of LogCluster algorithm is called LogClusterC.

LogClusterC borrows lots of source code from another open source data mining tool SLCT: http://ristov.github.io/slct/ .

The information of LogCluster algorithm and its prototype implementation in Perl: http://ristov.github.io/logcluster/ .

The history versions of LogCluster in Perl: https://github.com/ristov/logcluster/releases .

All the functions in LogCluster Perl version 0.03 are supported in LogClusterC. The basic functions and heuristics functions (options: --input, --rsupport, 
--support, --aggrsup, --wweight) are tested via various experiments in thesis.

The corresponding thesisï¼Œthe bash script to run the experiment and the raw plain text outputs in the experiment are stored in another GitHub repository: https://github.com/zhugehq/thesis-project-logclusterc-experiment-data .
